Hello! I am currently a Ph.D in The [Integrated Science and Engineering Project](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/) is at the [National University of Singapore](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6). I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof.T. H. Lee](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/lee-tong-heng/) (Fellow of the Singapore Academy of Engineering) in [Lee Group](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dP8oLwYAAAAJ&hl=en) .

I am a researcher driven by a passion for solving foundational challenges at the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical sciences. My work in **AI for Science (AI4S)** and **AI for Engineering (AI4E)** focuses on building intelligent systems that can understand, predict, and optimize complex real-world phenomena, leveraging advanced models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

My research philosophy centers on bridging rigorous academic theory with tangible industrial impact. This is reflected in my first-author publications in multiple **SCI-Q1 journals**, and complemented by hands-on experience developing cutting-edge AI solutions at industry leaders like **[Huawei](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/), [JD.com](https://www.jdt.com.cn/) (mentor: [Hui Shen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huishen/?originalSubdomain=cn)), and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)** as an algorithm engineer.

This pursuit is built on a foundation of consistent academic excellence. I was honored to be named an **Outstanding Graduate (Top 1%)** and graduate **ranked first** in my grade from both my Master's program at **[Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University)** and my undergraduate studies at the **[Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology)**. Looking forward, I am excited to begin my Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore (NUS) as a scholar of both the prestigious **[NUS President's Scholarship](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/scholarships/presidents-graduate-fellowship)** and the **[Hong Kong Government Scholarship](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/hong_kong_phd_fellowship_scheme)**.

I am actively seeking collaborations and coffee talküôÇüëçopportunities, and my research interests include:

- Dexterous hand operation and visual tactile guidance
- World Model and VLA
- Reinforcement learning and state estimation
- Learning based control

If you are interested in my research or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me via email: nanjinyao@163.com üòä
