I am a researcher driven by a passion for solving foundational challenges at the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical sciences. My work in **AI for Science (AI4S)** and **AI for Engineering (AI4E)** focuses on building intelligent systems that can understand, predict, and optimize complex real-world phenomena, leveraging advanced models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

My research philosophy centers on bridging rigorous academic theory with tangible industrial impact. This is reflected in my first-author publications in multiple **SCI-Q1 journals**, and complemented by hands-on experience developing cutting-edge AI solutions at industry leaders like **Huawei, JD.com, and Apple**.

This pursuit is built on a foundation of consistent academic excellence. I was honored to be named an **Outstanding Graduate (Top 1%)** and graduate **ranked first** in my grade from both my Master's program at **Tsinghua University** and my undergraduate studies at the **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)**. Looking forward, I am excited to begin my Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore (NUS) as a scholar of both the prestigious **NUS President's Scholarship** and the **Hong Kong Government Scholarship**.

My '小红书_red book' id number is '2600494343', Looking forward to learning together!!
