I am a Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), beginning in Fall 2025. I am a proud recipient of both the NUS President's Scholarship and the Hong Kong Government Scholarship. My research is centered on the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific disciplines, particularly focusing on **AI for Science (AI4S)** and **AI for Engineering (AI4E)**. I apply advanced machine learning models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to address complex problems in computational fluid dynamics, intelligent manufacturing, and robotics.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Master's degree from Tsinghua University, where I graduated first in my class.
